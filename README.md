# Flashcard Dictionary

This is a work in progress final project of [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/project/). 

## Objective of this project
It is to program a Chrome Extension that enables users to search for a word's definition after highlighting it during browsing. After the search is done, the word and its definition will be saved into database and retreived as flashcards for further study and review after this. There will be "quiz" to test a learners' retainment of vocabulary based on [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).
